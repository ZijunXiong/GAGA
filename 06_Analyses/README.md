# GAGA Analyses

We include here the scripts used in the comparative genomics analyses, as detailed in the STAR Methods of the manuscript.


We conducted the orthology assessment of the protein-coding genes in our 163 ant genomes, detailed in [Orthology](Orthology).


The phylogenetic analyses aimed to reconstruct the species tree across our ant sequenced species and outgroups can be found in [Phylogeny](Phylogeny). Orthology alignments and trees, see others?


Describe synteny in [Synteny](Synteny).


We explored gene family evolution using [CAFE](https://github.com/hahnlab/CAFE5) and the scripts can be found in [Gene_family_evolution](Gene_family_evolution).

The selection analyses including the scripts and methods are included in [Selection](Selection).


Describe trait evolution in [Trait_evolution](Trait_evolution). Here pgls and ancestral state reconstruction, add also here the final trait table to R.
