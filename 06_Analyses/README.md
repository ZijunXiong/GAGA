# GAGA Analyses

Note: In progress

We include here the scripts and methods used in the comparative genomics analyses.

The phylogenetic analyses aimed to reconstruct the species tree across our ant sequenced species and outgroups can be found in [Phylogeny](Phylogeny). 

We conducted the orthology assessment of the protein-coding genes in our 163 ant genomes, detailed in [Orthology](Orthology).

The selection analyses including the scripts and methods are included in [Selection](Selection).

We explored gene family evolution using [CAFE](https://github.com/hahnlab/CAFE5) and the scripts can be found in [Gene_family_evolution](Gene_family_evolution).
