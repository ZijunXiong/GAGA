# GAGA functional enrichments

We used the script [get_functional_enrichments_candidates_v4.pl](get_functional_enrichments_candidates_v4.pl) to retrieve the functional enrichment results (GO and KEGGs) and plots for a list of gene candidates (using the orthogroup ID), as well as a table with the functional annotations and caste-biased expression.
