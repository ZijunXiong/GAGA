# GAGA Analyses

Out analyses to explore trait evolution comprise:

- Ancestral state reconstructions - Example R script

- PGLS - script to run across all
We used several categorization of our trait to uncover and confirm correlations using PGLS. 
In addition, we used pglmm to confirm the results across discrete categorizations. 


### Positive selection

The parameters are that there is a difference of 50% of clades with positive selection, or enrihcment in more than 50% of the species; or enrichment in more than 40% when test or reference have only a low number of counts (i.e.: < number of independent clades /2). also, the candidates need to be under positive selection in at least 40% of the independent clades.
