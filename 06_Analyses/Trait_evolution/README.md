# GAGA Analyses

We provide the detailed trait table in the Supplementary Table S3A of the manuscript, and the simplified table to import in R for the analyses in Table S3B. 


## Ancestral state reconstructions

We used the script [ancestral_reconstruction_script.R](ancestral_reconstruction_script.R) for the ancestral state reconstruction analyses. The script contains the code for the analysis for discrete and continuous characters. 


## Phylogenetic correlations 

We used the script [get_pgls_genefam_vs_traits_computerome_v2.pl](get_pgls_genefam_vs_traits_computerome_v2.pl) to conduct the Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) analyses across all traits.
