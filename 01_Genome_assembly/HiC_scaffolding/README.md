# Hi-C scaffolding

We generated Hi-C libraries for 18 ant species, and we evaluated the library quality and conducted the genome scaffolding to improve the assembly to chromosome level using three different pipelines:
- 3D-DNA: https://github.com/aidenlab/3d-dna and https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer
- AllHiC: https://github.com/tangerzhang/ALLHiC
- Salsa: https://github.com/marbl/SALSA and https://github.com/esrice/hic-pipeline


We then evaluated the quality of the assemblies by visualiazing the Hi-C contact maps and manually curated them using JuiceBox.
