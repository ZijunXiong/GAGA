# GAGA Gene family evolution
Folder with the scripts used in GAGA
 We use CAFE, using the N0.tsv gene count table retrieved in orthofinder. But we excluded all stLFR short read assemblies given the low accuracy and incompleteness in the annotiation .
- Add scripts to filter out species from the species tree (for instance the stLFR)

Script blabla

1 - run all to see
2 - filter HOG with high variation
3 - run cafe 
4 - run error model
5 fix lambda an re run with all orthogroups
