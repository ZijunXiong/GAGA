# GAGA Selection pipeline

We used the following described pipeline to infer dn/ds, and positive selection using the coding alignment of each orthologous group and their respective gene trees. 








### Trait evolution pipeline

To understand trait evolution and retrieve gene candidates under positive selection, as well as relaxed or intensified selection associated with our analyzed traits, we followed the next steps:
