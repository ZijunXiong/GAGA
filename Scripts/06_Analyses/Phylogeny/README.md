# GAGA Phylogenetic analyses

We describe here the different phylogenetic analyses that we conducted in order to reconstruct the species tree for our ant sequenced species. In addition, we include the fossil data and scripts we used to calibrate the species tree. 

## Whole-genome alignments (WGA)

## Orthologs


## BUSCO

## Ultra-conserved elements (UCE)

## Tree dating
