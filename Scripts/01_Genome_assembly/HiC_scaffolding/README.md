# Hi-C scaffolding

We generated Hi-C libraries for about 20 ant species, and we evaluated the library quality and conducted the genome scaffolding to improve the assembly to chromosome level using three different pipelines:
- 3D-DNA: https://github.com/aidenlab/3d-dna
- AllHiC: https://github.com/tangerzhang/ALLHiC
- Salsa: https://github.com/marbl/SALSA and https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline


We then evaluated the quality of the assemblies and manually curated the assemblies using JuiceBox.
