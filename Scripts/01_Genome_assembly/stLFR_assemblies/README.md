### Genome assemblies only using short-read stLFR data

We were only able to sequence stLFR data for 20 species due to low DNA-quality extractions or low biomass available. We used two main software to conduct the short read assembly: Supernova and Masurca. 

Then, we scaffolded the assemblies generated by both methods using the stLFR reads with SLR-superscaffolder, adn chose between the best assembly.
