# GAGA
Folder with the scripts used to conduct the genome assembly and quality evaluation

## Genome assembly
- A: Genomes generated with both PacBio long- and stLFR short-reads
- B: Genomes generated with both PacBio long- and Illumina short-reads
- C: Genomes generated with only stLFR short-reads

## Chromosome level assemblies

We generated HiC libraries for about 20 ant species, and the scripts used are in "HiC_scaffolding" folder
